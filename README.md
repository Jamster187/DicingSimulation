# DicingSimulation
Simulation of casino dice game odds
This script simulates the house financial performance of a 1-10% edge in a percentile dice game and plots the results in a graph.
1. The house starts with $30k.
2. Each roll is a randomly generated integer between 1-100.
3. Each bet is a randomly generated integer between 1-300.
4. trial(100) will simulate a trial of 100 bets (trialSize = 100 in this case) and save all balances after wager() in a list.

Run the script, and it will simulate 100,000 bets and plot the financial performance of each chosen house edge.
